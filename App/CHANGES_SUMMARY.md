# AppNetSwitch - Complete Changes Summary

## Problem Statement
When running the app, toggle switches in the UI were not responding to clicks, preventing users from blocking/unblocking applications.

## Root Cause Analysis

### Issue 1: Signal Timing Problem
- **Problem**: PyQt6's `stateChanged` signal fires **before** the state actually changes
- **Impact**: Callbacks received the old state instead of the new state
- **Solution**: Implemented custom `userToggled` signal that fires after state change

### Issue 2: Signal Type Incompatibility
- **Problem**: `clicked` signal doesn't work reliably with custom-painted QCheckBox widgets
- **Impact**: Toggle clicks weren't being detected at all
- **Solution**: Override `mousePressEvent()` to directly detect user clicks

### Issue 3: State Logic Inversion
- **Problem**: Toggle logic was backwards (checked = blocked instead of allowed)
- **Impact**: Clicking toggle would do the opposite of what was intended
- **Solution**: Fixed logic: `if state:` (True) = unblock, `else:` (False) = block

### Issue 4: Missing Loop in Reapply
- **Problem**: `reapply_blocked()` method had no loop to iterate through blocked apps
- **Impact**: Previously blocked apps weren't re-blocked on app restart
- **Solution**: Added `for app_path in self.blocked:` loop

### Issue 5: Missing Exception Handler
- **Problem**: `_safe_block()` had try block without except clause
- **Impact**: Syntax error and improper error handling
- **Solution**: Added proper `except Exception as e:` clause

### Issue 6: Missing UI Layout Element
- **Problem**: Scroll area wasn't added to main layout in `setupUi()`
- **Impact**: App list wasn't visible in the UI
- **Solution**: Added `self.main_layout.addWidget(self.scroll_area)`

## Files Modified

### 1. `ui_main.py` - Complete Rewrite of Signal Handling

**Added imports:**
```python
from PyQt6.QtCore import pyqtSignal
```

**ToggleSwitch class enhancements:**
- Added custom signal: `userToggled = pyqtSignal(bool)`
- Added `_user_initiated` flag to track click source
- Overrode `mousePressEvent()` to detect user clicks
- Emit `userToggled` signal with new state

**populate_app_list() changes:**
- Store app info directly on toggle widget
- Connect to `userToggled` signal instead of `stateChanged`
- New callback method: `_on_toggle_user_toggled()`

### 2. `main.py` - Fixed Toggle Logic and Error Handling

**toggle_internet() method:**
- Fixed state logic: `if state:` means allowed (unblock)
- Added debug output for state transitions
- Proper action description: "Allow" or "Block"

**reapply_blocked() method:**
- Added missing `for app_path in self.blocked:` loop
- Now properly re-blocks apps on startup

**_safe_block() method:**
- Added missing `except Exception as e:` clause
- Proper error logging

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Run app as Administrator
- [ ] Verify app list loads with user applications
- [ ] Click a toggle switch
- [ ] Check console for debug output
- [ ] Verify toggle changes color (green/red)
- [ ] Check Windows Firewall for new rule
- [ ] Verify `data/settings.json` is updated
- [ ] Restart app and verify blocked apps are re-blocked
- [ ] Click toggle again to unblock
- [ ] Verify firewall rule is deleted

## Debug Output Example

**Successful toggle click:**
```
[DEBUG] ToggleSwitch mousePressEvent detected
[DEBUG] userToggled signal emitted with state=False
[UI] Toggle clicked for chrome.exe: new_state=False (1=allowed, 0=blocked)
[INFO] Toggle: chrome.exe → Block
[DEBUG] Blocking chrome.exe
[netsh stdout] Ok.
[DEBUG] Settings saved. Blocked apps: {'C:\\Program Files\\Google\\Chrome\\Application\\chrome.exe'}
```

## How to Test

1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator**
   ```bash
   cd c:\Users\RaSkull\Desktop\Code\AppNetSwitch
   .venv\Scripts\activate
   python App/main.py
   ```

2. **In the app window:**
   - Look for running applications in the list
   - Click on a toggle switch
   - Watch the console for debug output
   - Verify the toggle changes color

3. **Verify firewall rule was created:**
   ```bash
   netsh advfirewall firewall show rule name=all | findstr AppNetSwitch
   ```

4. **Check settings were saved:**
   ```bash
   type App\data\settings.json
   ```

## Expected Behavior After Fixes

✅ UI shows list of running user applications
✅ Toggle switches respond to clicks immediately
✅ Green toggle = app can access internet (allowed)
✅ Red toggle = app is blocked from internet
✅ Firewall rules are created/deleted correctly
✅ Settings are persisted to `data/settings.json`
✅ On app restart, previously blocked apps are re-blocked
✅ Console shows detailed debug output for troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting

**If toggles still don't respond:**
1. Check that you're running as Administrator
2. Look for error messages in console
3. Run `test_toggle.py` to test toggle in isolation
4. Check `DEBUG_GUIDE.md` for detailed troubleshooting steps

**If firewall rules aren't created:**
1. Verify admin rights
2. Test netsh commands manually
3. Check Windows Firewall is enabled
4. Look for errors in console output

**If settings aren't saving:**
1. Verify `data/` folder exists
2. Check write permissions to `data/settings.json`
3. Look for file I/O errors in console
